## Create Azure Service Principal for Authentication

To make it easy for you to authenticate through a non-interactive session to Azure, I've built a script to create an Azure Service Principal.

## Pre-requisites

In order to run the script, you need the following installed:

- Azure CLI
- JQ

## Service Principal Creation and Authentication

In order to login to Azure using a service principal, we use the following comand:

```
azure login -u $spn -p $password --tenant $tenant --service-principal
```

You can either pass the command manually, or you can include it in a shell script. However, in order for it to work, you first need to create the service principal.

In short, you need environment variables for the following:

```
spn=service_principal_name
password=service_principal_password
tenant=azure_tenant_id
```

To help you get started, I created the [Service Principal Creation Script](local_scripts/create_serviceprincipal.sh), which needs to be run on your local machine. You will need to have [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/xplat-cli-install?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-jessde) installed. 

To run the script, save it to the root of your repository and give it executable permissions:

```
chmod +x local_scripts/create_serviceprincipal.sh
```
The above example assumes you are in the root of your repo. You will want to adjust the file path accordingly.

Then run the script by typing the following: 
```
. ./create_serviceprincipal.sh id_name_here password_here role_here
```
or
```
source ./create_serviceprincipal.sh id_name_here password_here role_here
```
```
### Description of positional parameters

id_name_here - Name of Service Principal (for your reference only)
password_here - Password for service principal created
role_here - Desired role see [RBAC: Built-in roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-jessde)
```

Example:

```
. ./create_serviceprincipal.sh AzureDemo PasswOrd!! Contributor
```
NOTE: Your password needs to be a minimum of 12 characters and have some complexity incorporated to it. See more here: [Azure Password Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-policy?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-jessde)

The spn creation script will create a service principal for you and assign it the role of Contributor. The script will then export the necessary environment variables for the below command to work.

```
azure login -u $spn -p $password --tenant $tenant --service-principal
```
